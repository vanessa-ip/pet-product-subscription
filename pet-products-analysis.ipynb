    "# Case Study: Pet Product Subscription (DataCamp)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "PetMind is a nationwide pet product retailer in the United States. With inflation hitting 41-year highs, the company is planning to reduce the cost of customer retention by improving brand loyalty. The first strategy is to launch a monthly pet box subscription in three months. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The marketing team is preparing a list of popular products for the pet box subscription. The chief marketing officer wants to know whether the list should only include the products being purchased more than once. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Client Questions\n",
    "The marketing team has the following questions to help them make a decision: \n",
    "* How many products are being purchased more than once?\n",
    "* Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?\n",
    "* What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "* The rebuy data represents whether PetMind has re-bought a product from their vendor\n",
    "* The rating data is a rating by customers\n",
    "* The sales data is the total amount of revenue of a product\n",
    "* The price data is the price of the product sold to customers\n",
    "* Customers generally would like to have selection, variety and relevant products for their specific pet types and sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps performed on Google Sheets:\n",
    "1. Added column filters\n",
    "2. Verified data type criteria for pet_size, rating and re_buy\n",
    "3. Converted product_id data type to string \n",
    "4. Verified no duplicates for product_id \n",
    "5. Used filtering and sorting to verify no negative values for numeric data types\n",
    "6. Used COUNTUNIQUE and UNIQUE functions to check spelling and letter case consistency\n",
    "7. Used COUNTBLANK to verify no blank cells\n",
    "8. Applied TRIM to remove white spaces \n",
    "9. Converted sales data type from dollars to number\n",
    "10. Used COUNTIF to find the number of pet_type containing hamster or rabbit (46 total)\n",
    "11. Filtered and deleted rows containing pet_type hamster or rabbit\n",
    "12. Added a new field, units_sold as an integer for further analysis purposes. Calculated by sales/price\n",
    "13. Saved all changes in [Google Sheets - v1_pet_sales](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SnMA1WXM-LGgWbYj19kWMbgxkgGLzxP0szU_avk3F0w/edit?usp=sharing/?target=_blank)"

    "**Is there a statistical difference in sales, units solds, and rating between rebuy and not-rebuy products?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "* Conducted a T-test hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups in [Google Sheets - summary stats & t-test](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SnMA1WXM-LGgWbYj19kWMbgxkgGLzxP0szU_avk3F0w/edit?usp=sharing/?target=_blank)\n",
    "    * Ho: there is no difference\n",
    "    * Ha: there is a difference that the sales of rebuy products are higher or lower than not-rebuy products. P-value would need to be < 0.05\n",
    "* Used 2 tail in T-test because a group's values can be above or below the mean\n",
    "* Used type 3 in T-test because it is measuring different observation groups with different variance \n",
    "* Used Alpha < 0.05 which accepts 5% of error that the difference is due to chance \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "1. Is there a difference in **sales** between rebuy and not-rebuy products? \n",
    "    * Result: 0.747 p-value \n",
    "    * Reject Ha, therefore there is **no difference in sales**\n",

    "    * Result: 0.661 p-value\n",
    "    * Reject Ha, therefore there is **no difference in units sold**\n",

    "    * Result: 0.010 p-value\n",

    "\n",
